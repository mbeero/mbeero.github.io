On Space Size and Balance
seblester.com

	This sites use of high contrast is very effective. The black header does a good job of drawing your eye to the topic of the site which is Seb Lester, a Calligrapher.
	The size of the links for different pages does not take away from the title or main content. I think the balance works well because the title and categories balance the thumbnails on the right side of the homepage.

	Space and balance-wise I really like this site, it's clean. The logo balances the links to shop, blog, etc. the negative space provides a good backdrop and I really like how the feature hero images run off the page.
