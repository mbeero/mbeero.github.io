		<p>This page is about Matt Bero.</p>

		<p>Born and raised in Green Bay, WI Matt grew up with a pen in his hand. Always drawing on things, including the living room wall where he drew waist-high grass with a green crayon, it became second nature. </p>

		<p>His love for letters was apparent through drawings of graffiti at a young age as well as other script styles. After taking a typography class in college his appreciation for type and letters was solidified. This further developed into calligraphy and lettering which he focuses on when he's not designing for the digital space.</p>

		<p>His inspiration comes from everywhere! Tattoos, graphic design, web design, typewriters, old books, the internet, nature, graffiti, sign painting and much much more!</p>

		<p>Matt loves pizza, that's why it's on his body forever. So instead of trying to pay him in Trident Layers, try pizza.</p>
